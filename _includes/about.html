              <h2>About me</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>I am a mobile developer, specializing in modern Android Native development. Other than mobile, I have experience with back end and front end web development.
                    I graduated with computer science degree from Utah State University in 2016. Since 2014, I have been working in the industry, when I started working as a software technician writing automated UI tests for mobile devices.
                    While still attending university, I took a competitive internship at a business accounting software company, where I worked on back end technology to generate investmet reports.
                    After graduating with my bachelor degree, I worked on several highly utilized mobile apps, including iFit, Groupon and developing a point of sale system for Yum! Brands (Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut).
                    I currently live in Chicago, IL. In my free time, I like to cook, play guitar and play PC games. I am a big fan of public transit and urbanism and have advocated for better transit in Chicago.</p>
