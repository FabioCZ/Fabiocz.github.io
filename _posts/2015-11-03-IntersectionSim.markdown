Welcome to the project page for Intersection Simulator.

## Project Introduction:

As connected and autonomous vehicles will become more and more common in the coming decades, this technology can be used to reduce traffic congestion, a big problem in major metropolitan areas. This can reduce fuel costs and travel time, as well reduce carbon footprint from fossil fuel vehicles. Cars will be able to communicate with each other, as well as communicate with a central traffic management system. Reacting to unexpected traffic events, diverting cars based on congestion or optimizing traffic lights can be some of the strategies used in this project.

## Project Implementation:
Project is implemented in C# and will include a WinForms based GUI. Intersections are modeled using QuickGraph .NET graph library.
